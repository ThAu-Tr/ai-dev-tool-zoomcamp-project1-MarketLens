# Manual provider smoke tests

These optional tests use your own EODHD or Marketaux account and API quota. Automated tests use mocks.

## Marketaux smoke check

To manually smoke-check Marketaux after provider composition is enabled, configure `MARKETAUX_API_KEY` in the backend environment and run one dashboard refresh with one or more tracked symbols. Confirm the refresh completes, then inspect `GET /api/dashboard` for metadata-only articles and source links. The adapter makes separate bounded queries for tracked symbols and followed industries (at most two requests, with three results per request); this live check is optional and must use your own account and quota. Automated tests mock HTTP and do not call Marketaux.

## EODHD smoke check (manual, uses your account)

After migrations, start the backend with `EODHD_API_KEY` set and request `POST /api/refresh` once. Confirm the response succeeds and `GET /api/dashboard` shows an `asOf` timestamp and currency supplied by the provider. Then request `GET /api/timeline?date=YYYY-MM-DD` for one eligible date with known EODHD coverage and confirm its `source` is `newly-loaded`; request the same date again and confirm `source` is `archive`. The second request should not call EODHD. Each refresh may try the intraday endpoint and then fall back to daily closes; use one tracked asset and avoid repeated retries to stay within the free account's daily request limit. Adapter tests mock HTTP and never consume API calls.
